      <h3>Scientific Perspective</h3>
        <h5>
          <p>
          Naturally, closed water bodies that are situated in dry regions experience fluctuations in water level. Obviously, Jordan being a dry region experiences such fluctuations. However, there seem to be claims that climate change is to be a cause of major changes in such fluctuations. Geologists have been observing the several changes in water levels. In Jordan, the most resourceful body of water is claimed to be the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea, was used by not only Jordan though, but also by Israel. Due to this potential overconsumption of water, as well as the possibility of climate change, it is claimed that the water in the Dead Sea has been experiencing major fluctuations. 
          </p>
          <p>
        	In response to these major fluctuations, people turned away from the Dead Sea, and turned towards groundwater. However, the groundwater they turned towards wasn’t exactly the best. At first, they’d overused the groundwater in Jordan, making it unable to reach the levels it was first prior to their overusage. Then, they’d considered using water from the Disi aquifer which stretched from Saudi Arabia to Amman in Jordan. Thankfully, the construction of the Disi aquifer had been halted, due to the fact that the water from the Disi aquifer wasn’t as clean as it could get. This project began in 2013, and was to cost around $1.1 billion. It would pump around 100 million cubic metres a year to Amman in Jordan. 
          </p>

          <p>
          However, tests have proven the fact that, the water contains high levels of naturally occurring radioactivity.  In fact, sources state, that it contained radioactive material at a rate that was above WHO’s - World Health Organization - standards. Additionally, it seems that this problem isn’t going to solely affect the Disi aquifer or the regions surrounding it, but all of the countries in the Middle East and North America. In the February of 2009, 37 samples of water from the Disi aquifer were taken. They were inspected by a geochemist named Avner Vengosh from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina along with the rest of his team. According to their report, the water contained naturally occurring and carcinogenic radium isotopes. The combined isotope levels are around 2000% higher than international drinking water standards. It explains that the isotope activities are similar to those that occur in sandstone, a type of sedimentary rock. It explains how the activity of the isotopes should be controlled with the element thorium and uranium that exist naturally in sedimentary rock. The decay of these products are the two isotopes - radium 226 and radium 228. Each of the isotopes have half-lives (form of measurement) of 1,600 years which, in human years is around less than six years. What is even scarier is the fact that, when this radium is consumed, it can cause bone cancer, which really isn’t good. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Statistics show that if the people of Amman, Jordan were to consume of this contaminated water, then it would cause for 8000 more people to die. However, these deaths are solely made off of the assumption that this radium enters the body solely through water. There are obviously more ways in which radium could enter the body, such as, when the contaminated water is to water agriculture and the radiation enters plants or vegetables on the field that one would later eat. As mentioned earlier, it is noted that this problem will not only impact the Middle East and North America, due to the fact that they may all potentially contain similar sandstone aquifers. Through further research, it was discovered that the water with greater amounts of radioactivity were found in areas where water was declining. Though the reason for this remains questionable, the water situated in this sandstone aquifer continues to become unsuitable for agricultural use and human consumption.

          The BRGM, a French national service finds the fact that Saudi Arabia pumps water from the same sandstone aquifer - named Saq aquifer in Saudi Arabia - is horrifying. The BRGM explains that the amount of water being pumped from the Saq aquifer to citizens in Saudi Arabia has increased the amount of water it extracted from 2 billion cubic metres per year during 1985, to 8.7 cubic metres per year during 2005. It explains that Saudi Arabia extracts about ½ of the water that is located in its aquifers. Obviously, regarding the fact that some of this water could contain large levels of radiation, for all we know almost everyone in Saudi Arabia could end up experiencing some sort of health problem due to this radiation. However, luckily, Saudi Arabia is treating this groundwater and removing radioactive elements prior to distributing the water to citizens. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Unfortunately, the Jordanian Ministry for Water and Irrigation does not find the high radiation levels in the water a problem. They stated in return that, the tests that they’d done had provided lower radiation levels as the results. Additionally, the ministry had claimed that they would dilute the supposed radium filled water with radium-free water, so as to reduce the radiation exposure to around 0.4 millisieverts. However, even 0.4 millisieverts, is still four times the WHO standard, and it would be terribly difficult to reduce the radiation exposure to that solely through diluting the water. Additionally, Germany’s Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) took samples from a part of the Disi aquifer in which radium activity was low. They concluded that it would take about one billion cubic metres of water without radium in order to dilute the radium filled water and bring the radium levels below the WHO standard. However, the question remains as to where Jordan would receive all that water from. 
          </p>
          <p>
          After extracting the water through wells, it was still quite clear that the levels of radium in the water were well above WHO standards. Additionally, there have been primary signs of genetic damage caused by the radium. In 2010, workers who changed filters in underground wells were examined. Their blood had been found to have 11 times more chromosomal damage than those who were the ‘control’ aspects of the experiment. It was found that this chromosomal damage could cause changes in genetic material, and illnesses in their children. Hopefully, things will change, and this water will not be extracted any more.

    <h3>Technological Perspective</h3>
    
      <h5>
        
        <p>
        Research has shown evidence of water fluctuations in the Dead Sea - a very resourceful water body in the country Jordan. In 560 AD, it is estimated that the water was 405m below the sea level. In 1825, the water receded - it was instead 394m below the sea level. In 1929, it was an estimated 389m below sea level. Now, very recently, in August 2017, the water was said to be at a level of 435m below sea level. This evidence supplies knowledge that Jordan is slowly, losing the water it relies on. However, at the same time, it cannot be considered an “environmental disaster,” due to the fact that this process of fluctuating water levels has been occurring naturally for the past 120 000 years. The only thing that this fluctuating water level has been causing is the over-extraction of groundwater from aquifers - resulting in an absence of freshwater from the region.

        <p>
        In order to fix this problem and bring back water to Jordan, in August 2013, the Jordanian government had claimed that they would begin the a water diversion project to divert the water in the Red Sea to the water of the Dead Sea. This water conveyance project was very technical. The Red Sea and the Dead Sea were both very different kinds of waterbodies. Obviously, the Red Sea contained a greater quantity of water than the Dead Sea, and therefore, each body of water had a different level of elevation. In fact, sources state this difference is about 435 m. This recognition allowed for people to recognise that the different elevations could create hydroelectricity. It was realized that this hydroelectricity could potentially be used in order to desalinate the water from the Red Sea and Dead Sea, as they both contained high traces of salt and they obviously had to be desalinated in order to be consumed. This project, obviously, seems like a great idea, as, not only is it obtaining water for Jordan, but also energy.

    <h3>Societal Perspective</h3>
    
      <h5>
        
        <p>
          The society of Jordan has truly been impacted and influenced by this issue. In this area of the world, water seems to be a limiting factor. Additionally, as the population increases throughout Jordan, we continue to see issues arising due to the lack of water in the area. To be more specific, Jordan contained a population of about 9.456 million in 2016, and those numbers are still rising. Additionally, the majority of the population in Jordan have settled together, densely in urban areas, leading to an annual rate of urbanization of 1.6% during 2011. There have been numerous other factors that had been the cause to this immense population, including refugees, decreasing infant mortality rates, increasing wealth, and the trend to have more children. Sources state that, almost half of the water in Jordan is wasted by the people. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To add onto the decreasing water levels, water was diverted from The Jordan River, by other countries who were competent to use the water. Syria, Jordan, and Israel had built dams there, which, in return had caused for the water to lose 95% of its original flow. Experts believe that, the conflict between all three countries was what motivated them to extract as much water as they could from The Jordan River. It is believed that, if the three countries had cooperated together, then The Jordan River wouldn’t have experienced such a loss. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Obviously, governance over Jordan is a crucial aspect in maintaining the water sources in Jordan. It was initially considered to extract water, through pipes, from the Disi aquifer, which stretches from Amman, Jordan to Saudi Arabia. However, the construction of pipes to form this conveyance, has constantly been halted due to local disputes. Normally, a contract would be handed to a businessman or tribe for management or transport. Then, an opposing tribe would charge at the construction site, and shut down the work. Workers found that, while working with local Jordanian communities, communities found the benefit of achieving water treatment in areas with less population density. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          What this has proved is the fact that it would be difficult to implement technologies into local communities in the Middle East and North Africa to aid the communities in obtaining the resources they may lack. However, because Jordan experiences issues with factors such as migration, politics, and demography, the solutions may be farther than we think. It seems essential in aiding to Jordan’s security and accountability to proceed with a solution to this issue. Security will provide to Jordan borders, stability, economic and societal developments to aid big infrastructure projects that may aid the nation in its water scarcity issue. Accountability will allow for the Jordanian government and politicians to be considered, as well as the projects they may propose. This way these projects may be acknowledged by citizens of Jordan. If this problem doesn’t cease to exist, then the problems will only grow larger. The economy will falter by increasing water prices, due to the lack of available water, and there will only be distress etched upon the nation. It seems that the government must be aided by organisations and contributors, to which they must turn upon in order to succeed with good governance.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
          	In 2009, it was believed that a solution was found to the water crisis in Jordan, but it was only adding to it. In 2009, wells were built on the Disi watershed that stretched from Amman, Jordan to Saudi Arabia - it was named Saq aquifer in Saudi Arabia. However, this watershed contained naturally occurring radium, above WHO standards, that caused genetic damage to men who replaced filters in these wells. However, this was only realized in 2010, when the men were examined. Though this may have seemed like a relief to the people of Jordan, it was only a sign that there was worse to come. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Luckily, in 2013, it was decided that water from the Red Sea would be transported through pipes, to the Dead Sea, in order to save the Dead Sea from losing all of its water. Obviously this would have been a good sign not only towards industries in the area who relied on the water, but also people, who needed more water to survive. However, despite all of the work that is being done in order to help the people of Jordan, the people of Jordan are still feeling unrest. In fact, in a video, there was a man living in Jordan received water solely once a week, and it was the only water they had to survive on for the rest of the week. Luckily, it isn’t as bad as the restrictions a government may pose on water usage during a drought.

    <h3>Environmental Perspective</h3>
      
      <h5>
        
        <p>
          The fluctuating water levels in Jordan, have obviously caused for the world to fear Jordan possibly losing all of its water. In fact, sources state that Jordan could potentially be the first country to run out of water. The rising population of the world, poses a threat to our water sources, ands a result, the demand on water is estimated to rise up to about 50% by 2050. However, it seems that, the Dead Sea, in Jordan, will not shrink according to a geologist, due to the fact that this sea is a major contributor to chemical and tourism industries in Jordan. Therefore, Jordanians focus upon using water from groundwater resources and aquifers from other areas. However, Jordanians extract huge amounts of water from groundwater resources, sources stating that Jordan takes out 160% more groundwater than how much water nature can recharge. Obviously, all of this over-usage of water has solely resulted in a greater lack of water to everyone. 
        </p>
        <p>
	In addition, it was noticed that the agricultural practices in Jordan used up of large quantity of water as well. Sources explain, that during 2004, Jordan’s agricultural sector used over 62% of Jordan’s water sources. From this, it can be inferred that really, more than half of the water in Jordan has been wasted upon agriculture, when it could have been used wisely or preserved for future use. The sources explained that the cause for this had to do with high amounts of financial aid that were supplied to the farmers. However, they couldn’t just prevent the citizens from farming, as it appeared to be a tradition around the region. In response to this, it was suggested that farmers use drip irrigation methods and grow crops that don’t rely as much on water. This was, luckily, received by the farmers positively.
        </p>
        <p>
	However, it seems that the water scarcity has already, greatly impacted the water sources in Jordan. Obviously, due to the over-extraction of water in Jordan, it is essential that somehow, through precipitation the water is recharged and brought back to its original state. Still, due to the fact that the levels of precipitation vary in this desert-like region, 90% of the precipitation evaporates, before it can recharge the aquifers. Not only that, but the water from Azraq Aquifer, located in North-East Jordan, is extracted at a rate, that is double the sustainable amount per year, according to the standards of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. In 1990, the groundwater table levels of Azraq had receded greatly, and the quality of both the water and the soil had decreased as well. Due to this, Jordan had lost the good groundwater that they’d received from Azraq, and there was no way the aquifer could be recharged completely if the people continued to use up the water. Additionally, the environment that lay above the aquifer was a wetland. The loss of water in the Azraq aquifer had caused for birds that migrated to the wetland, to change their migratory patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
	Additionally, there is other major implications on the environment that are caused by this water crisis. According to other sources, Jordan owns around 23 km of land on the Red Sea. However, it truly only protects 7 km of out of the 23. This way, pollution and litter manage to gather in the sea, most resulting from run-offs from farmland and from industries. Obviously, what Jordan doesn’t realize, is the fact that, this can result in the death or harm of aquatic organisms, excessive plant growth, cause tumours or birth defects in organisms that make them unable to reproduce, and cause many changes to the ecosystem of the environment. Luckily, despite this, the IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature is working with several others in order to encourage local governments and citizens to encourage water conservation and to recharge water resources in Azrak and Jordan.
