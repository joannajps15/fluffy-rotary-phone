      Jordan Water Crisis

      Results and Consequences

        <p>
      There has been a wide array of results and consequences, because of this water crisis in Jordan. Initially, as mentioned earlier, Jordan had been experiencing fluctuating water levels in its water bodies. Several geologists found that the water bodies in Jordan were decreasing at alarming rates, both because of geographic factors and possibly, climate change. Obviously, several people in Jordan had been fearing the fact that they would face water scarcity. In fact, in response to this, as mentioned previously, the IUCN - International Union for Conservation of Nature - had been working with local governments and individuals in order to promote water conservation in order to recharge water resources in Jordan. Luckily, the IUCN did manage to aid Jordan in sustaining its water.

In 2009, Jordan began the Disi aquifer project, in which they extracted groundwater from the Disi aquifer through wells. Still, the Disi aquifer had contained traces of radioactivity that were above the WHO standards. Unfortunately, the Jordan Ministry for Water and Irrigation had ignored that, and claimed that they would dilute the radium filled water with non-radium filled water, to bring the radiation level down to WHO standards. However, the water still contained radium at a level that was above WHO standards. In 2010, workers who replaced filters in underground wells were examined, and they had been found to have had chromosomal damage in their blood. 

        <p>
Jordan administrations had seen that diverting water from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea, as a good option to gain water. Though Jordan already had the Disi aquifer for water and though Jordan so no need to extract water from a sea and desalinate it, the government had agreed to do so. They saw that the Red Sea would help to recharge the Dead Sea with water, as the Dead Sea was receding at a rate of about, one meter per year. However, what they didnâ€™t realize, was the fact that the saltiness of the Dead Sea could greatly impact the life of the very few organisms that resided in the Red Sea. It was seen that this connection could result in a variety of environmental and political problems. Nevertheless, on May, 9. 2015, the government investigated into whether the canal could be implemented between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea. The Jordanian Water Minister and Israeli Infrastructure Minister both signed an agreement regarding the building of this canel, as of the fact that these two water bodies concerned both countries.

Then, in June 2009, the Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister, announced the building of a supposed pilot-pipe that was around 180 km, and would stretch from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. It was stated that the pump would divert around 200 million cubic metres per year, and that, half of the water would be desalinated for consumption by Jordan, while the other half would remain in the Dead Sea. In October 2009, the Jordanian government mentioned beginning a potential first phase of the Red Sea - Dead Sea project. During 2012, social assessments, environmental assessments, and studies on alternatives were conducted. Eventually, in August 2013, the Jordanian government claimed that they would be going forward in the first phase of the water diversion project. On November 27, 2016, the Jordanian government had chosen 5 investment groups to implement the project. The $100 million first phase of the project, is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2018, and to be finished by 2020.
