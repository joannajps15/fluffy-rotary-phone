      In the Middle East lies Jordan - a country suffering from water scarcity. This, obviously, seems to be an up and coming problem in several places in the world that are just like in Jordan. Jordan appears to be attempting to approach this water scarcity with several solutions, however, none just seem to be the best. This water crisis has been caused by and resulted in falling water levels, water diversion projects, pollution of water bodies, multi-use and competition of water bodies, as well as conflict due to water between two countries. However, it seems as though the fluctuation water bodies, water diversion project, and pollution of water bodies, are the main aspects of the Jordan water crisis today.
