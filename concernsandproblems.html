      <p>
      The Jordan water crisis has obviously been both a cause and result of several concerns. The majority of these concerns and problems are addressed in the perspectives, and results and consequences, however it is still important to recognise the concerns and problems as a whole. Initially, prior to the Disi aquifer water extraction and Red Sea to Dead Sea conveyance, there was a huge concern regarding the amount of water that Jordan still had to live off of. As sources state, there is a growing demand for water, as the population of Jordan increases rapidly. Additionally, there was also a concern that, due to the conflict between Syria, Israel and Jordan, all of the countries would attempt to extract more and more water from the Jordan River, in order to compete with each other. Additionally there were concerns over the governance over Jordanians. This was due to the fact that, when the government attempted to build forward the pipes and wells for the Disi aquifer extraction project, locals didnâ€™t know of the fact that there was construction going on to extract water for the people. So, they attacked construction sites, and shut down the work that was occurring. This was a serious problem, not only in terms of water extraction, but also in terms of government-citizen relationships. Another concern is the fact that, the Disi aquifers could greatly impact the health of many, due to the high levels of radium it contains. Many people, outside of Jordan, had obviously recognised the fact that Jordanians could develop bone cancer, genetic damage, and furthermore death, if they consumed the water. Even though the Jordan Ministry for Water and Irrigation had accepted the consumption of this water, it still did not meet WHO standards. Additionally, there was a great fear of the environmental impact the Red Sea to Dead Sea Conveyance could cause. Obviously, the Red Sea and Dead Sea, were two different rivers, that contained different ecosystems. Now, the Red Sea, as resources state, contains a bounty of biodiversity, in comparison to the Dead Sea - which was running out of water and had a greater concentration of salt. If we are to connect the two seas, then we would connect the two ecosystems as well. The connection of these two ecosystems, would cause for the two different ecosystems to try and adapt to the new environments. The fact that the two different rivers contain different amounts of salt, would impact the organisms that live on the side with less salt, as they would be forced to experience higher salt levels. Additionally, according to osmosis, if the organisms were to experience higher salt levels, then, the water within their cells would move outside, into the ocean. This could, potentially, impact the life of the organisms, but it could help dilute the salty water and allow for the concentration of salt inside to decrease. However, all in all, there would definitely be major changes in both ecosystems as they merge together.
