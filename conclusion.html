        <p>
        In conclusion, the Jordan water crisis is in fact, very serious, and it is something that we can all learn from. By researching it, and developing some general knowledge regarding the issue, people can truly understand what goes on in areas suffering from water scarcity. Luckily, Jordan has approached this situation with both the Disi aquifer agreement and the Red Sea to Dead Sea water conveyance. Though these two may not have been the best of options for Jordan, it certainly was something, and it allowed for several to understand how Jordan can approach this issue as it attempts to prevent itself from losing all of its water. Thankfully, there still is time for Jordan to change its mindset, and consider other potential decisions the nation could make to benefit itself with water.
